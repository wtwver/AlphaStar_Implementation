    "#### Actor loss\n",
    "\n",
    "The actor loss is based on [policy gradients with the critic as a state dependent baseline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKqxumCuAAY&t=62m23s) and computed with single-sample (per-episode) estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L_{actor} = -\\sum^{T}_{t=1} log\\pi_{\\theta}(a_{t} | s_{t})[G(s_{t}, a_{t})  - V^{\\pi}_{\\theta}(s_{t})]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $T$: the number of timesteps per episode, which can vary per episode\n",
    "- $s_{t}$: the state at timestep $t$\n",
    "- $a_{t}$: chosen action at timestep $t$ given state $s$\n",
    "- $\\pi_{\\theta}$: is the policy (actor) parameterized by $\\theta$\n",
    "- $V^{\\pi}_{\\theta}$: is the value function (critic) also parameterized by $\\theta$\n",
    "- $G = G_{t}$: the expected return for a given state, action pair at timestep $t$\n",

    "A negative term is added to the sum since the idea is to maximize the probabilities of actions yielding higher rewards by minimizing the combined loss.\n",

    "The $G - V$ term in our $L_{actor}$ formulation is called the [advantage](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro.html#advantage-functions), which indicates how much better an action is given a particular state over a random action selected according to the policy $\\pi$ for that state.\n",

    "In addition, without the critic, the algorithm would try to increase probabilities for actions taken on a particular state based on expected return, which may not make much of a difference if the relative probabilities between actions remain the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, suppose that two actions for a given state would yield the same expected return. Without the critic, the algorithm would try to raise the probability of these actions based on the objective $J$. With the critic, it may turn out that there's no advantage ($G - V = 0$) and thus no benefit gained in increasing the actions' probabilities and the algorithm would set the gradients to zero.\n",
